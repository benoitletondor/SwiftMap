# SwiftMap

SwiftMap is an implementation of HashMap made in Swift. This is a simple playground I made to play with Swift and some hash stuff.

SwiftMap is made using Swift 3 and rely on Swift build tools to be executed.

This implementation is (greatly) inspired by [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) implementation of the Map and doesn't try to invent anything new.

### Disclaimer

This is a playground project I made only for test purpose, it's not intented for production and I'm not responsible of any bug you may found.
